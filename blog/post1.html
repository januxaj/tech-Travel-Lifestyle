    <h2>✈️ How I Traveled to Japan on a Student Budget</h2>
    <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> July 2025</p>
    <p>Japan is often considered a pricey travel destination, but with careful planning, I made it work on a student budget. Here’s how I did it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flight Deals:</strong> I booked my ticket three months early using Skyscanner and saved over 30%.</li>
      <li><strong>Accommodation:</strong> I stayed in capsule hotels and used Couchsurfing and HostelWorld for budget options.</li>
      <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> The Japan Rail Pass helped me explore the country affordably.</li>
      <li><strong>Food:</strong> I enjoyed cheap, quality meals at local ramen shops and convenience stores.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This trip taught me that traveling doesn’t require a fortune — just resourcefulness and planning.</p>
